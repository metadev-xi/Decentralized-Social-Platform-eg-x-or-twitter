# Decentralized Social Platform

A censorship-resistant, blockchain-based social media network that reimagines microblogging for the Web3 era. This platform combines familiar social mechanics with decentralized architecture, allowing users to own their content, control their data, and participate in governance without relying on centralized intermediaries. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures immutable content storage, transparent moderation policies, and equitable value distribution to content creators while maintaining the dynamic, real-time conversation experience that made traditional social networks popular.
